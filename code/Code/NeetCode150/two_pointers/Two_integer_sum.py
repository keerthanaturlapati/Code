# Given an array of integers numbers that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

# Return the indices (1-indexed) of two numbers, [index1, index2], such that they add up to a given target number target and index1 < index2. Note that index1 and index2 cannot be equal, therefore you may not use the same element twice.

# There will always be exactly one valid solution.

# Your solution must use 
# 𝑂
# (
# 1
# )
# O(1) additional space.
